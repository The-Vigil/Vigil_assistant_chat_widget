## Backend Integration
The frontend widget seamlessly integrates with a RunPod serverless backend. When a user sends a message (either text or voice), the widget securely transmits the request to the RunPod endpoint. The backend processes the request using:

- Voice transcription via Whisper for audio input
- LLaMA 70B model for natural language understanding and response generation
- OpenAI's TTS for converting responses to natural speech

To ensure a production-ready setup, the RunPod backend deployment features:
- Chunked processing for efficient audio handling
- Parallel processing of LLM and TTS requests
- Secure HTTPS communication with the frontend
- Automatic resource cleanup and memory management
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
